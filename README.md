Do not expect greatness. I am learning, and that is amazing. I am using [this great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4&list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M).

## Features

‚úÖ For now it did not explode. A great success.

---

## How It Works

- The kernel is compiled using a cross-compiler targeting i686-elf.  
- It runs on QEMU for easy testing without rebooting your actual system.  
- GRUB is used as the bootloader to load the kernel.  
- The goal is to expand and experiment, adding new features along the way.

## Installation & Usage

TOMAT-OS requires a GCC cross-compiler, GRUB for booting, and QEMU for testing.

```bash
